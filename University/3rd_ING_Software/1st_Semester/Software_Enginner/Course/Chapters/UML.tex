def UML :

Type Of uml diagram


UML semi formel 

categorizes into two :
structure : diagram de class solution OOP 
Comportement :

use case diagram :

actor : user , hardware , other software 

note : 
one person can play many rols 

cas d'utilisation = features = elipse
bonhome = actor
mix of natural language , and graphical symbols
associate actor with use case with line

use case : is a graphical representation of a behaviour diagram
that is composed of actors that can be huaman (intern,externe) , or 
non human hardware that interact with the software , or other softwares
, each actors has one or many rols we create links called association between actors and use case 
(softwares features)

type of relation 
association : actor ---> use case

possible relation between use case and use case
relation between softwares features

generalisation <=> looks like extend relation
remarque : relation can be applied on actors too

                     extends
extention : source ----------> detination
if condition == true execute source use case 
case extention

                     include
inclusion : source ----------> detination

if actor want to do source use case he has to do destination use case first
only applied between user case 

note :
difference between inclusion and extension
