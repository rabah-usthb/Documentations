\section{UML}
\subsection{Introduction}
As seen in the previous sections, the requirements document is very important, as any mistake, ambiguity,
or misunderstanding of the client's needs can lead to a project restart. We've reviewed the high-level
structure of a requirements document; one of the most important parts is the functional requirements, which can
be expressed in natural language. This approach is easy to implement and understand but isn't very precise, doesn't
automate verification, and relies solely on the linguistic experience of the writer. There is also a formal approach
based on mathematical theory, which automates verification, is very precise, but is hard to master and 
time-consuming. Finally, there is a semi-formal approach that benefits from the advantages of both natural and 
formal language; an example of this is UML (Unified Modeling Language).
\subsection{UML(Unified Modeling Language)}
UML is a semi-formal language that is easy to understand and widely used by developers. It divides into two main categories of diagrams:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Structure Diagram : Represent the static aspects of a system, showing its classes, objects, and relationships. 
    \item Behaviour Diagram :  Describes the dynamic aspects of a system, illustrating how actors interact with the system and how the system changes over time.
\end{itemize}
In this section we will focus on Use case diagram

\subsection{Use Case Diagram}
A use case diagram is a graphical representation of a behavior diagram, composed of three main elements:

\begin{itemize} 
    \item Actors: Actors represent roles that interact with the system. Each actor performs a set of 
actions called use cases, which represent features of the software they interact with. Actors are
depicted as stick figures and can be either human or non-human.
   \begin{itemize}
    \item Human actors: Individuals using the system.
    \item Non-human actors: Entities such as hardware (e.g., sensors, cameras) 
     or software (e.g., APIs, dependencies). 
   \end{itemize}
   \item Use Cases (Features): These represent features or functions of the software and are shown as ellipses , they have to be programmable.
   \item Associations: Associations are the connections between actors and use cases, depicted as lines. These lines 
indicate what action (use case) each actor can perform. 
\end{itemize}

\textbf{\underline{Internal \& External Actors : }}

In a use case diagram all actors have to be internal to the software and all use cases must be
features from the software that are programmable
\begin{itemize}
    \item Internal Actor : must interact with the software 
    \item External Actor : don't interact with the software
\end{itemize}

\end{prettyBox}

\begin{prettyBox}{Note}{red}

\textbf{\underline{The Ideal Level Of Decomposition Of Use Cases }:}

\vspace{0.2cm}
In a use case diagram, the level of decomposition for use cases should strike a balance. It shouldnâ€™t
be too specific, as this can make the diagram cluttered and difficult to read, nor too generic, which
can make it hard to understand. A moderate level of detail is ideal.

\vspace{0.15cm}
It's acceptable to leave some use cases at a more generic level without decomposing them, especially
since the diagram is accompanied by a document that provides detailed explanations. 
This document defines and elaborates on all sub-use cases as needed.

\end{prettyBox}

\vspace{1cm}
\subsubsection{Relations In Use Case Diagram}
\begin{itemize}
    \item  \textbf{Generalization}:  Generalization establishes a hierarchical relationship that helps organize
actors and use cases in UML diagrams. 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item  \textbf{Between Actors}: When a child actor is linked to a parent actor, it inherits all the roles and
responsibilities of the parent actor,in addition to its own specific roles. This helps clarify who can perform
what actions in the system.

            \item  \textbf{Between Use Cases}: Allows a feature to be divided into multiple, more specific
versions. These child use cases represent the same general feature but can differ in their implementation or method.
This promotes reusability and clarity in how features are handled in different scenarios.

the diagram below shows a generalisation relationship between Actors where the child actor Service Manager 
is inheriting all roles of the parent actor teller + his own roles

the identification case must execute first

\textbf{\underline{Extension Between Use Cases:}}

\vspace{0.25cm}
the diagram below shows an extension relationship between use cases where each time the transfert case is invoked
the balance check case will be executed if the value is \textgreater= 10000 DA

\begin{prettyBox}{Note}{red}
\textbf{\underline{Difference Between Inclusion \& Extension }:}

\vspace{0.2cm}
In The inclusion relation the Destination case will always execute before source case in all cases , whereas
in the extension relation the source case will execute before destination source only if certain conditions
are met

\vspace{0.25cm}

\textbf{\underline{Extends With No Conditions }:}

\vspace{0.2cm}
If an extend relation doesn't have an explicit condition it just means that it's an option and
the actor can decide wether to trigger the extended use case or not (option)
