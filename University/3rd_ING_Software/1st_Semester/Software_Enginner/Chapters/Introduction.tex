\subsection{What's Software Engineering?}
Software Engineering is a branch in the field of Computer Science that revolves around designing, testing, coding, and  maintaining high-quality software 
while being able to understand the needs of the client.

\subsection{What's the Difference Between a Programmer and a Software Engineer?}
People often confuse a programmer with a software engineer. While it is true that both write code for software, a software engineer is a step ahead 
of the programmer. Not only does the engineer program, but they also possess non-technical skills that allow them to understand and guide the client 
according to their needs, create the architecture of the software, and apply various techniques and methodologies for well-structured software. 
In other words, a programmer $\subset$ software engineer.\\
