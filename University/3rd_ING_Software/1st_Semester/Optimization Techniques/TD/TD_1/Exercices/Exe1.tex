\section{Exercise 1: Part-Time Work}
Adem works two part-time jobs, E1 and E2, and wants to limit his total working hours to no more than 12 per week. For each hour worked
at E1, he requires 2 hours of preparation, and for each hour worked at E2, he requires 1 hour of preparation. Adem cannot spend
more than 16 hours preparing each week. Given that he earns 40 MU per hour at E1 and 30 MU per hour at E2, how many hours should
he work at each job to maximize his total income?\\
MU = Monetary Unit

\textbf{\underline{\Large Solution:}}
\begin{multicols}{2}
\textbf{\underline{Variables Definition:}}

Let \(x_1\) be the number of hours worked in E$_{1}$.

Let \(x_2\) be the number of hours worked in E$_{2}$.

\textbf{\underline{Constraint:}} 

\[
\left\{
    \begin{array}{l}
       \forall x_1, x_2 \geq 0 \quad \text{(Non-negative work hours)}\\\\
        x_1 + x_2 \leq 12 \quad \text{(Work limit of 12 hours per week)}\\\\
        2x_1 + x_2 \leq 16 \quad \text{(Preparation time limit of 16 hours)}
   \end{array}
   \right.

\[
f(x_1,x_2) = 40x_1 + 30x_2 
\]

The goal is to maximize Adem's income by maximizing \(f(x_1,x_2)\), while adhering to the work and preparation time constraints.
