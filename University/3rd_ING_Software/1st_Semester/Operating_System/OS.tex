    \item \textbf{Theoritical Complexity}: It's theoritical complexity calculated through \(f(n)\) and \(T(n)\) by supposing that each basic instruction has same execution time \(\Delta t\)
    \item \textbf{Experimental Complexity}: It's real life complexity calculated by executing a program in a machine and using a clock to get the exact time
