\begin{prettyBox}{Conclusion}{green}
From the two plots we can conclude that the theoritical complexity plot is similar to the experimental complexity plot,
and also that theoritcal complexity follows a pattern in values since its \(\Delta t\) has a static value
\end{prettyBox}

To Draw the plots i used the below python script :
