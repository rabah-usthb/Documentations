\begin{prettyBox}{TP4Q5 Procedure}{myblue}
We created a procedure that takes as parameter values of commande to be able to insert on commande table ,
we declared exception for each case where insertion is impossible :
\begin{itemize}
    \item pk : primary key already exist 
    \item fk\_client : client foreign key doesn't exist
    \item fk\_mes : messager foreign key doesn't exist
    \item fk\_emp : employee foreign key doesn't exist
\end{itemize}
