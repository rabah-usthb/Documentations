\lstinputlisting{Questions/SQL/q4.b.sql}
\begin{prettyBox}{PL/SQL Code}{myblue}
We made a pl/sql block that uses cursor to loop through all the clients , and inside the while loop
for each iteration we will call the tp3q4 function so we can have number of order made by that client and be able
to print it
\end{prettyBox}
