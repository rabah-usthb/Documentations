\section{Impacts of a Cyberattack}
\begin{prettyBox}{Impacts}{myblue}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Data Breach}: Unauthorized access to sensitive client or organizational data. This may include\\ encrypting data for ransom (ransomware), sharing confidential information, or selling it on the dark web.  
    \item \textbf{Denial of Service (DoS)}: Disrupting or halting the services of an organization, making them inaccessible to users.   
    \item \textbf{Financial Loss}: Hacking into bank accounts, demanding ransom (ransomware attacks), or causing service interruptions that result in revenue loss.  
    \item \textbf{Damage to Reputation}: Eroding client trust or tarnishing someone's reputation by exposing compromised or sensitive data.  
    \item \textbf{Loss of Clients}: Organizations may lose clients due to the exposure of sensitive information, compromised systems, server outages, and interruptions in services.  
\end{itemize}
\end{prettyBox}

\end{prettyBox}

\section{Responses to Cyberattacks}
\begin{prettyBox}{Responses}{myblue}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Reduce the Impact}: Taking measures to minimize the damage caused by the cyberattack, such as isolating affected systems, restoring backups, or limiting access.  
    \item \textbf{Accept the Risk}: The least effective response, where no action is taken to counter the attack. This could include surrendering to attackersâ€™ demands, such as paying a ransom.  
    \item \textbf{Refuse or Resolve the Risk}: Actively countering the attack by refusing to comply with attackers and taking corrective actions to fix vulnerabilities or breaches.  
    \item \textbf{Transfer the Responsibility}: Shifting the burden of dealing with the cyberattack to a third party, such as an insurance provider or a managed cybersecurity service.  
\end{itemize}

\section{Steps For Protection (Deming's Wheel)}
\begin{prettyBox}{PDCA}{myblue}
    The PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) cycle is a continuous improvement process widely used in
cybersecurity to ensure effective protection and adapt to evolving threats. Below are the four key steps:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{\textcolor{green}{P}lan}: Identify goals, assess risks, and develop strategies to strengthen cybersecurity.
        \item \textbf{\textcolor{green}{D}o}: Implement the cybersecurity measures, like deploying firewalls and training staff.
        \item \textbf{\textcolor{green}{C}heck}: Monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of security measures through audits and testing.
        \item \textbf{\textcolor{green}{A}ct}: Address weaknesses and refine security measures to adapt to new threats.

\section{Attacks}
\begin{prettyBox}{Attacks}{myblue}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{DOS (Denial of Service):} An attack that overwhelms a system, 
making it unavailable to users by flooding it with excessive requests.
\item \textbf{DDOS (Distributed Denial of Service):} A more advanced form of 
DOS where multiple systems (often compromised) are used to flood a target, 
making it harder to mitigate.
\item \textbf{MITM (Man-in-the-Middle):} An attack where an attacker 
intercepts and potentially alters communication between two parties without 
their knowledge.
\item \textbf{IP Spoofing:} An attack where an attacker disguises their IP 
address to impersonate another system, often to gain unauthorized access or 
launch further attacks.
\item \textbf{DNS Spoofing/Poisoning:} An attack where an attacker corrupts 
DNS records to redirect users to malicious websites instead of legitimate ones.
\item \textbf{Smurf Attack:} A type of DOS attack where the attacker sends 
spoofed ICMP packets to broadcast addresses, causing multiple systems to 
respond and overwhelm the target.
\item \textbf{Port Scan:} An attack where an attacker scans a system for open 
ports to identify potential vulnerabilities or services to exploit.
\item \textbf{Phishing:} A social engineering attack where attackers trick 
users into revealing sensitive information (e.g., passwords) by pretending to be a 
trusted entity.
\item \textbf{Hoax:} A false message or warning designed to deceive users, 
often causing unnecessary panic or spreading misinformation.
\item \textbf{Bot or Zombie:} A compromised computer controlled by an attacker, often used to carry out malicious activities like DDOS attacks or spam distribution.
\item \textbf{Backdoor:} A hidden method of bypassing normal authentication or 
security mechanisms, often left by attackers to regain access to a system.
