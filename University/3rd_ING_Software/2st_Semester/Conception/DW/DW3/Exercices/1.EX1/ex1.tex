\begin{prettyBox}{Explication}{myblue}
The context here is the \texttt{View} class, since that's what the user interacts with. 
From there, the user can trigger different interchangeable events that will be 
handled accordingly by the controller. Therefore, the controller is the \texttt{Strategy} class, 
and in general we can have an event trigged from the mouse or from the keyboard
