\begin{prettyBox}{Explication}{myblue}
The context here is the \texttt{Data} class, which holds the list of integers to be sorted. 
At runtime, the user can choose between different sorting methods interchangeably. 
Therefore, the \texttt{Sort} class is the abstract strategy, and the different sorting methods 
inherit from it.
