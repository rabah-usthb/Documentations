\begin{prettyBox}{Explication}{myblue}
We used the \texttt{Constant} and \texttt{Variable} classes to create the 
\texttt{Monomial} class, which holds the name of the variable, the power, and the coefficient. 
The \texttt{Monomial} is a leaf element, and the \texttt{Polynomial} is the complex element 
that holds a list of \texttt{Monomial}.
